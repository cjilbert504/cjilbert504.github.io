The question of why I decided to learn to code has many avenues within it. To start, up to this point in my life the majority of my jobs were all manual labor jobs with the exception of  the live sound production work I did on and off again whilst working a regular full time job. To depart from this path momentarily, I also have played music throughout my life and have always enjoyed the creative aspect of playing music. Now to get back on track, I felt stuck in my job and unsatisfied with what I was doing as a career path (or lack thereof really). I was also going through a divorce and worried about how to navigate that and plan ahead for being able to provide for my soon to be ex-wife and I's 3 year old daughter. I struggled to figure out a plan of what I could do for work to be able to provide for my daughter and myself while also being able to have a good work life balance to be able to spend and enjoy time together with her, and also honestly feel fulfilled and excited about the job that I was doing. Where could such a unicorn job be found without having to go back to school? 

This is the point where I stumbled across and ad for a local coding bootcamp where I live in New Orleans, Louisiana. I found myself extremely intrigued and signed up for the free two week prep program. Upon attending, I immediately found myself excited about it all! However, I felt as though the program was lacking something, someting that I couldn't pinpoint. Thats when I started to research other programs and found Flatiron School. After doing exstensive research on the school I decided this was the place for me. It felt like it had a very strong, positive and supportive  community and had a well thoughout out approach to imparting the knowledge to their students. I applied immediately! After a video interview and about two days, I received an email confirming my acceptance into the program and I was completely ecstatic!

Now two full months into the program, I am still very excited about everything and couldn't be happier with my decision.
